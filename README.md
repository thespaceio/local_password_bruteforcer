# 🔐 Password Cracker (Brute Force Demo)

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates a **brute force password cracking technique** using random guesses. It continuously generates random character combinations until it matches the user-provided password.

⚠️ **Warning:** This is for educational and demonstration purposes only. Do not use this script for unauthorized access or unethical practices.

---

## 📜 How It Works

1. The user inputs a password.
2. The script attempts to "crack" the password by:
   - Generating random guesses using all printable characters.
   - Repeating the process until the randomly generated string matches the original password.
3. The matched password is then printed.

The script uses:
- `string.printable`: A built-in string that contains digits, letters, punctuation, and whitespace.
- `random.choices()`: For generating random characters with replacement.
- A loop that continues until the correct password is found.

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
$ python password_cracker.py
Please input your password: ab1
7hZ
$&1
ab1
Password: ab1
````

> The script keeps guessing until it gets the right password. This may take a long time depending on the password length and complexity.

---

## 📝 Code Explanation

```python
import string
import random

password = input("Please input your password: ")

guess = ""
character = list(string.printable)

while guess != password:
    guess = random.choices(character, k=len(password))
    guess = "".join(guess)
    print(guess)

print("Password: " + password)
```

* `string.printable` includes all characters that could be used in a password.
* `random.choices(..., k=len(password))` generates a list of random characters equal in length to the password.
* `''.join(guess)` combines them into a single string for comparison.

---

## ❗ Limitations

* **Inefficient**: This brute force method is extremely slow and impractical for long or complex passwords.
* **Randomness**: It doesn't try every possible combination in order — it picks guesses randomly, which can take even longer.
* **Security Risk**: Do **not** use real or sensitive passwords when testing.

---

## ✅ When to Use

* As a demonstration of why password security and length matter.
* In cybersecurity classes to show brute force limitations.
* As a base for building more advanced password-cracking simulations or tools (e.g., with dictionary attacks or heuristics).

## 📌 Disclaimer

This tool is for **educational use only**. Do **not** use it to attempt unauthorized access to systems or data. Doing so is illegal and unethical.

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.x
